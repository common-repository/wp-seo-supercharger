== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What if visitor is from Google SSL? =

Google [SSL search](http://support.google.com/websearch/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=173733) encrypt search queries. We can't do anything about it.

= Can I filter search query? =

Yes you can do this in General Settings.

= How do you retrieve related posts? =

We provides three methods: search, category and tag.  We'll try every method in the order you chosen to find related posts. To make it work with different types of pages (Post, Page, Archive, Home, 404, etc,..), we highly recommend search method.

= How category and tag works? =

When people landed in a post from search engine, say PA, we'll use PA's category and tag to find related posts. Unfortunately, it works with Post only since other types of pages don't have category and tags.

= What if a post has multiple categories and tags? =

We'll pick up a category/tag randomly. If no other posts found under that catgeory/tag, we'll choose another one.

= How search method works? =

Essentially, we'll be using wordpress built-in serach functioning with search query to find the related post. It works the same way as the search box in your sidebar.

= Can I customize the new post? =

We provide an option called Related Post Template in Post Settings to make the new post more customized.

Currently, we support: [rimage_url] will be the URL of the first image in that related post if any. [rpost_title] is related post's title.

[rpost_content] is related post's full content and you can also do this [rpost_content:200] to use first 200 letters only. [rpost_link] is related post's link. Besides, it supports HTML code.

Important Note: We'll remove &lt;img&gt; html tag from the related post template if no image URL found.

= Will it generate duplicate post? =

First, we won't retrieve the post that's generated by WPSS as related post. Second, we provide an option in Post Settings to disable duplicate post when post entitled search query already exists.
